# Graph-Based Document Classification System

This repository contains the implementation of a document classification system using graph-based methods, developed as part of my 6th semester Graph Theory coursework. The system aims to accurately categorize text documents into predefined classes or topics automatically, leveraging the unique properties of graph representations.

## Features
- *Graph Representation*: Documents are represented as graphs, capturing the structural relationships within the text.
- *Similarity Calculation*: Utilizes Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) for calculating similarity between document graphs.
- *Classification*: Implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for categorizing documents based on graph similarities.
- *Dataset Support*: Supports custom text datasets for training and testing the classification system.
- *Scalable*: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Method Used for Document Classification
The primary method used for document classification in our project is the Graph-based Approach inspired by the paper "Classification of Web Documents Using a Graph Model" (IEEE, 2003). This approach involves representing documents as graphs, calculating similarity between graphs using MCS, and using a KNN classifier for classification based on graph similarities.
